## Git vs. GitHub



---
## Initial Setup
In order to use git you need to make a Github account. You will need to go to [Github](https://github.com/).   
After you have created your account, you will need to verify your account using the email you used to sign up with. After you have done all of this go to c9.io and log in using the green cat icon on the top right

## Repository Setup
Make a directory using "mkdir". Also make sure your in workspace. After making a directory cd into it and type "git init" to actually use git commands.

## Workflow & Commands
* **git status** - This command is very useful. It tells you what is going on in repository and if any commands used before worked or not.
* **git push** - This allows you to push a commit to the cloud and use it later.
* **git clone** - This command allows you to copy a repository 
* **git commit -m** - This git command allows you to take a snapchat and save what ever you have done.
